# Reconcilers TODO Application

Welcome to the Reconcilers TODO Application project. This project is designed to help you understand the basics of React and how to manage state in a frontend application. By building a simple TODO application, you'll get hands-on experience with React's fundamental concepts, including components, state management, and event handling.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a frontend TODO application that allows users to add, remove, and update tasks. It's structured to guide you through the process of creating a library similar to React, focusing on direct DOM manipulation methods and then transitioning to React's state management.

### Key Features:

- Add TODO items with a title and description.
- Remove TODO items from the list.
- Update existing TODO items' title and description.
- Understand the difference between manipulating the DOM directly and using React's state to manage updates.
